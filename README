This simple python script takes a Latitude JSON File which you can get via Google Takeout (https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:latitude) and converts it into a useable format.

Usage:
latitude_json_converter.py input output [-h] [-f {kml,json,csv}]

input                Input File (JSON)
output               Output File (will be overwritten without prompt!)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -f {kml,json,csv}  Format of the output


Available formats:

kml (Standard):
KML file with placemarks for each location in your Latitude History. Each placemark will have a point location and a timestamp

csv:
Comma-separated textfile with a TimeStamp and a Location field, suitable for upload to Fusion Tables

json:
Correctly formated JSON file, the JSON file you get as export from Google Takeout has duplicate keys which makes normal parsing impossible
