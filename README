This simple python script takes a Latitude JSON File which you can get via Google Takeout (https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:latitude) and converts it into other formats.

Usage:
latitude_json_converter.py input output [-h] [-f {kml,json,csv,js,gpx}] [-v]

input                Input File (JSON)
output               Output File (will be overwritten without prompt!)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                          Show this help message and exit
  -f, --format {kml,json,csv,js,gpx}  Format of the output
  -v, --variable                      Variable name for js export


Available formats:

kml (default):
KML file with placemarks for each location in your Latitude History. Each placemark will have a point location and a timestamp

csv:
Comma-separated textfile with a TimeStamp and a Location field, suitable for upload to Fusion Tables

json:
Smaller JSON File with only the TimeStamp and the Location

js:
JavaScript File which sets a variable in global namespace (default: window.latitudeJsonData) to the full data object for easy access in local scripts. Just include the js file before your actual script.

gpx:
GPS Exchange Format, where points (including timestamps) are grouped together into tracks.
